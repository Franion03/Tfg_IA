*** CNN
In this example, alexnet(pretrained=True) creates an instance of the AlexNet model and loads the pre-trained weights. The input_tensor is a random tensor with the correct input size for AlexNet (224x224 pixels, 3 color channels). The forward pass is done by simply calling the model like a function with the input tensor.

Remember to ensure that your input data is correctly preprocessed and matches the input size expected by the model. Also, if you're working with real images, they should be normalized in the same way as the images used to train AlexNet.

As for the code you provided, it seems to be a part of the AlexNet implementation in PyTorch. The AlexNet class is a subclass of nn.Module, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. The __init__ method is defining the architecture of the AlexNet model. The features attribute is an nn.Sequential module, which is a container for modules that should be executed in a sequence. It's defining the first few layers of the AlexNet model, including convolutional and pooling layers.


*** MLP
The script then reads training and testing data from CSV files using a custom BatchGenerator class. The data is preprocessed and converted into the appropriate format for training the MLP.

The script then creates an instance of the MLP class and uses the Keras Tuner's BayesianOptimization to find the best hyperparameters for the MLP. The tuner is set to maximize the recall on the validation set. Early stopping is used to stop the training when the validation recall does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

Once the best hyperparameters are found, the script builds the best model, trains it on the training data, and evaluates its performance on the testing data. The model is saved after training and the performance metrics are printed out. Finally, a confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the performance of the model.
